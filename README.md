# AI Code Generator

This is a full-stack application that uses AI to generate React components. It includes a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with Next.js.

## Features

- **Backend**: Supports AI integrations (Google Gemini LLM, OpenAI, etc.), MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.IO.
- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React 19. Includes live JSX preview using `react-live`.
- **API**: Provides endpoints for user authentication, session management, and AI-driven component generation.

## Setup

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
4. Start the server: `npm start`

### Frontend

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
